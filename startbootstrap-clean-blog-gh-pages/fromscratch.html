    <h4>Bombay</h4>
    <p>Want a panther, but also enjoy both of your arms? The Bombay cat breed is the kitty for you!</p>
    <p>Bred specifically to look like the Indian black panther, the Bombay is a mix of the Burmese and the black American shorthair. The result is a cat that does indeed resemble the big jungle cat, without having a single drop of wild blood in his pedigree.</p>
    <p class="funfact">Fun Fact: Despite being bred for their patent-black coats, some Bombay kittens are born pure white. These coats darken within their first year.</p>

    <h4>British Shorthair</h4>
    <p>British shorthair cats are one of the oldest recognized cat breeds, first thought to have been brought to Britain by the Romans. Prized for their soft, plush coats and rounded bodies, British shorthairs could almost be mistaken for living teddy bears.</p>
    <p>One of the most popular cat breeds in the world, the British shorthair is appropriately named. Not only do they have a thick, plush short coat, they also have a friendly yet no-nonsense—that is, rather British—sensibility about life. British shorthairs make ideal family cats and enjoy being with their owners, but may turn up their noses at being held or cuddled too much.</p>
    <p class="funfact">Fun Fact: With his chubby cheeks and big green eyes, Puss in Boots is generally considered to be a British shorthair (despite his Spanish accent).</p>

    <h4>Burmese</h4>
    <p>With their huge eyes, outgoing personalities, and dog-like tendencies, Burmese are the perfect cat for winning over people who say they don’t like cats.</p>
    <p>It's really hard not to immediately like Burmese cats. Intelligent, playful little dynamos, Burmese are incredibly social to humans and will quickly learn to play interactive games like fetch or tag. They also make excellent ambassadors for any self-professed "non-cat people," thanks to their affectionate, almost dog-like personalities and their giant, expressive eyes that make Burmese cats look like they were ripped straight out of a Margaret Keane painting.</p>
    <p class="funfact">Fun Fact: The ancestors of the Burmese originated in Thailand, where they were kept in monasteries.</p>
